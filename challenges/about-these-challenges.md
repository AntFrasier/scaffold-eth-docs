# 🧙‍♂️     About the Speed Run

**Challenges** are some fun tasks you can take on to level-up your Scaffold-eth 🏗 skills and eventually join the [Buidl Guidl](https://buidlguidl.com) 🏰  and get streamed some ETH 💸\
\
There are challenges such as creating a Decentralized Staking App, building Multisig Wallet, creating an on-chain NFT. Alongside teaching the syntax, they are created to show what's possible with Ethereum.

We welcome your feedback to make it better for the next developer 👨🏼‍💻
