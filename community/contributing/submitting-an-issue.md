# Submitting An Issue

Submitting an issue should not be an issue, so we made it easy.&#x20;

1. Head over to [https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/issues](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth/issues) and select New Issue.
2. You will see a couple templates there to choose from, and if you don't want to use one of those you can just click Open A Blank Issue below.

Try to be as thorough as possible when addressing your issue that way we know how to best allocate our developers.
